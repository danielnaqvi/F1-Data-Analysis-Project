Formula 1 Data Analysis (2000-2017)

This project explores Formula 1 qualifying performance across two different eras using a combination of Kaggle data, SQL Server, and Tableau. I analyzed long‑term trends from 2000–2017 in Tableau, then performed a deeper SQL‑based comparison of Q3 qualifying times in 2022 vs. 2023 for the races that occurred early in the 2023 season: Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, and Australia.
